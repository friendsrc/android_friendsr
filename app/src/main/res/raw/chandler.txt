Chandler Muriel Bing was born on April 8, 1968, to an erotic novelist mother and a transgender woman who later became the star of a Las Vegas drag show. He is of Scottish ancestry. He is an only child and is apparently from an affluent family, as he mentions his family hired servants such as a pool boy and a house boy (both of whom he suspects slept with his father). Chandler's parents announced their divorce to him over Thanksgiving dinner when he was nine years old, an event which causes him to refuse to celebrate the holiday in his adulthood. Chandler had started smoking at the age of 9 because of their divorce. He went to an all-boys high school. Chandler was Ross Geller's roommate in college. Chandler met his friend Rachel Green while celebrating Thanksgiving with the Geller family during his first year at college. On a tip from Monica, Chandler later moved to Apartment 19 in Greenwich Village, Manhattan, across the hall from Monica and her roommate Phoebe Buffay. He moves in with actor Joey Tribbiani, who becomes his best friend.
