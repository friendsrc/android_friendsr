Rachel Green worked as a barista at Central Perk cafe. During that time, her personality evolved from a spoiled egotist to a less self-centered and more likeable character. She grew from a suburban girl who dreamed of being the wife of a doctor and spending her time shopping, to that of a single mother with a career. She lost her virginity in the back of a van, before she had reached the tenth grade. Rachel also received plastic surgery on her nose, which she claims was due to a deviated septum. Rachel's focus on vanity comes at the expense of domestic skills or common knowledge. After she had worked at Central Perk for two and a half years Gunther forced Rachel to retrain, because she does not know the essentials of work, such as where to stack trays. Previously Rachel was being financially supported by her father and planning on marrying an orthodontist who would become the sole source of her income. Rachel broke off her engagement with Barry, because she realized on their wedding day that she didn't love him. After breaking off their engagement Rachel cut the credit cards her father gave her in half, leaving herself broke. Rachel found work as a waitress at Central Perk cafe but at times takes long breaks to sit with her friends and regularly gets orders confused. With encouragement from Joey and Chandler, Rachel later resigned from Central Perk to pursue a career in fashion. Joey then found her a job with Fortunata Fashions as a personal assistant. Later that season, she found work as an assistant buyer at the Department store Bloomingdale\'s with the help of colleague, Mark. Unfortunately after Mark resigns and her boss Joanna dies, she was demoted to personal shopper. She then left to start a career at Ralph Lauren as the coordinator of the women\'s collection. Ralph Lauren was impressed by her work and in "The One with Rachel's Assistant" she was promoted to merchandising manager, a position allowing her an assistant, Tag Jones, who shd has an affair with.
